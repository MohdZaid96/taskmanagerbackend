# Task Management System Backend

## Description
This project provides a backend solution for a task management system built with Node.js and Express.js. It includes RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations on tasks, data validation, error handling, and integration with MongoDB/MySQL for data storage. Additionally, it incorporates rate limiting, Winston logger, email verification using emailRegex, authentication, and authorization for enhanced security, stability, and monitoring capabilities.

## Features
- **Node.js and Express.js Setup**: Set up a robust Node.js server using the Express.js framework.
- **RESTful APIs**: Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks via HTTP endpoints.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity by validating input data, such as task title and description, to prevent errors.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize MongoDB/MySQL as the database to store and manage task information efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to clients during API requests.
- **Winston Logger**: Integrate Winston logger to log application events, requests, responses, and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Rate Limiter**: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests clients can make within a specific timeframe, enhancing system stability and security.
- **Email Verification**: Use emailRegex for email validation and implement email verification functionality to ensure valid user registration.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure endpoints and restrict access to authorized users only.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the database connection settings in `.env` file.
4. Run the server using `npm start`.

## Usage
- Use the provided RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Ensure proper input validation to maintain data integrity.
- Monitor application logs generated by the Winston logger for debugging and troubleshooting.
- Manage request limits to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.
- Implement user registration with email verification.
- Secure endpoints using authentication and authorization.
